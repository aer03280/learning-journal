This past week was supposed to be the most difficult.  And it was.  The concepts - events, constructors, DOM - fell more on the theoretical side of programming.  There was more thinking than doing.  And still a lot of doing.  I am still trying to figure out the Constructor function I built.  It was create when I had a very vague understanding of what I was doing and then rehashed as I went along with assignments throughout week.  The end result is a shit-show.  It just seems very messy and I'm having a difficult time cleaning it up.  A good lesson was learned that you should have an idea of where you're going with a project before starting it.

On Friday we had a couple instructors from 401 talk to the class.  One of them made the point that he only expects his students to really understand the material covered from a week ago.  This was comforting.  I put so much pressure on myself to get it all the first time I learn it but that's totally ridiculous.
