Learning Journal Day 8

This week's material is conceptually difficult but not impossible.  I really can't imagine trying to figure this out without instructors present to walk me through steps.  I feel like I just need to see a bunch of examples.  The book does a good job explaining the concepts but the examples aren't entirely thorough or broad.
I've always been a perfectionist with my work.  It's costing me.  I spend way too much time trying to figure things out on my own.  I've done a better job asking for help this week.
I am learning to accept being behind in my work.  Last week I struggled to keep up with the readings and stayed awake way too late.  This week I'm taking it easier on myself.  I am reading as much as I can, eating better and getting at least six hours of sleep. (That's still not enough sleep!)
