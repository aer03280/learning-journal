Wow, what a crazy week.  So glad it's the weekend so I can catch up!
I was feeling like I was falling behind with all the labs, reading assignments, and keeping up with complicated concepts...but it feels like things are continuing to click for me.  Almost like there's an Aha moment around the corner.  

The terminal has been a big focus and I am feeling comfortable with it now.  It seems like every Learning Journal is filled with instructions.  Here are more :
