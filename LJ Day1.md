DAY1
Today was incredibly fast paced! If I hadn’t just read the terminal and git tutorials over the weekend, I would have been lost.  I know this course is going to push me to work hard.  But I’m excited to learn which is the best motivator.

Some important notes I took:

Javascript...
prompt 
alert
console

CSS...
id should only be used once per page
class is to control a group

Git...
git clone…..http:…COPIES REPO FROM GITHUB TO TERMINAL
git add file.txt STAGES THE CHANGES
git status PROVIDES STATUS (WHETHER IT IS STAGED OR NOT)
git push origin master UPDATES TO GITHUB
git pull upstream master ****PERFORM DAILY TO UPDATE CHANGES FROM THE ORIGIN(HUB)
git remote -v
git remote add upstream
gIt fetch origin <>
**Add Commit Push
-b creates the new branch otherwise checkout will just switch a branch
