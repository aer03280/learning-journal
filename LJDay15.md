Learning Journal Day 15

Spent the entire weekend studying.  (Even had an extra hour with the time change.)

It felt good to turn in my busmall assignment with clean, working code.  I think that's the first time I've been able to turn in a completed assignment on time.  

The group project got off to a good start.  I'm excited about our idea.The team is cohesive with our vision.  Everyone is eager to participate.  I expect the build out will go smoothly.  

Notes on Floats...

- using floats in your div. There is a left flow and a right flow, and the elements that are not floated can easily fill the space that is not taken by the floated elements.
- Clear: left” tells each person floating left that they should align themselves behind the first element that is floated left.
- “clear:both”. This allows you to reset the flow of elements, as opposed to continuing to maintain a right, left and normal flow.
