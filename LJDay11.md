Learning Journal Day 11

Even though today's assignment required skills that I already had, I had no idea how to begin.  Understanding the concepts and knowing how to apply them has a major learning curve.  

I had a check-in last week and it sounded like I was keeping at pace with the class, but this week I feel kind of dumb.  Am I supposed to be able to figure this stuff out??  The assignment I just turned in for the Cookie Stand was all kinds of broken.  I spent most of my weekend going over the code trying to figure out why the new store stats aren't showing on the table (they were before I made changes).
