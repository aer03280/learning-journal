Learning Journal Day 13

This week has felt more doable.  The concepts are all coming together.  Today's assignment was on local storage.  I felt confident in my preliminary plans (before we started coding) and within three hours was able to implement them and complete the assignment.  I think it still needs a bit more work but that's the least amount of struggle I've felt completing an assignment so far.

I'm looking forward to the final project.  Having an entire week to work on one project with some other folks pooling our brain-power will be great.
