Learning Journal Day6


Objects...I knew week two was coming.  I'm glad I got a lot of sleep last night.  It's going to be a challenging week.

I keep feeling like I'm missing important details.  Like I don't have all the pieces of the puzzle to complete my assignments.  I understand the code demos in class and the content of the reading, but it's the putting it all together in a new context of an assignment that is tuff part.  And that annoys me because problem solving is my thing, that's what I enjoy.  Oh, the learning curve...It'll all make sense <em>eventually</em>.  I will just hang on to my Grit until then. (Apparently JS files don't pick up the <em> code?  I guess I'll see once it's submitted to my repo...)

Object Literals.....

var Object = {
  Keyname1: value,
  Keyname2: value,
  Mehtod: function() {
    return this.keyname1 - this.keyname2;
  }
};
